# Juice Bar

Shows battery level as a bar on the top, similar to Power Bar. Currently does
not support any custom settings/colours as it was written for my own use for
now. Draws bar assuming that max charge is 80%.

Custom settings may be added later on, but are not planned for now.

## Usage

1. After installation, start the app and switch on the bar.
1. The permissions page will appear, and Juice Bar needs to be given permissions
   to draw over other apps.
1. After pressing back to return to the app, the service will be started.
